<h4> what is python </h4>
<p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.

It has built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, making it very attractive for rapid application development, scripting, or as a glue language to connect existing components together.

Python was originally created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum </p>
